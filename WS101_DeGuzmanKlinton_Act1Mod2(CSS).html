         <h1>I am Me</h1>
	 <img src="image-PSULogo.png" alt="Region's Premier University of Choice">
         <p>On <strong>20 October 1993</strong>, my journey on so-called "<strong>Life</strong>" began. My name is <strong>Klinton F. De Guzman</strong>, the fifth child among the seven children of Franco De Guzman and Angeles Ferrer. I was born in Bacoor, Cavite. Our permanent address is in Linoc, Binmaley, Pangasinan. On the other hand, our recent address is in Baybay Lopez, Binmaley, Pangasinan. I can speak fluent Tagalog, Pangasinan, and a little bit of English. I strongly believe that "<strong>Life comes and go but legacy lives forever</strong>."</p>
         <p>I finished studying my pre-school on <strong>2000</strong> back in Bacoor, Cavite. After moving into Dagupan, Pangasinan, I finished <a href="Elementary1(CSS)" style="active">elementary</a> on <strong>2006</strong> in Dagupan City, Pangasinan. Also, after graduating from elementary, we moved to Binmaley, Pangasinan where I finished my <a href="HighSchool2(CSS)" style="active">high school</a> on <strong>2010</strong>. Some of my achievements in high school, both in academics and extra curricular activities are:
         <ul>
            <li>Academics Excellence Award;</li>
            <li>1st Honorable Mention Award;</li>
            <li>Member of BCS Men's Basketball Championship Team 2010;</li>
            <li>Member of Binmaley Catechist Batch 2010; and</li>
            <li>3rd Placer in Balagtasan: Buwan ng Wika 2010.</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
         <p>Finding passion in life is very hard. I am glad to call myself as one of the few who has passion in <strong>Math</strong>. I resume studying and started my <a href="Tertiary3(CSS)" style="active">college</a> life on <strong>2019</strong>. I am now in my 3rd Year taking up BS Mathematics Major in Computer Information Technology. I am very fond of computers ever since my childhood. Computer games like Counter-Strike (Half-Life) made me fell in love with computers in an instant. From that moment on, the love I felt with computers grew even more, and that leads up to now. Some of my other hobbies besides computer games are:
         <ol>
            <li>playing basketball;</li> 
            <li>watching Netflix; and</li>
            <li>singing karaoke on Youtube.</li>
         </ol>
	 <p>I always compare myself into a sponge. Like a <strong>sponge</strong>, I aways see to it that I absorb some lessons that every day gives me and use it for the betterment of myself the next day. I also believe that doing my best in every aspect of life to be the best version possible is always the true purpose of being alive.
